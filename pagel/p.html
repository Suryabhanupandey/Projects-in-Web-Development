          <li><strong>HTML5:</strong>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is an abbreviation of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. HTML 5 is the fifth and current version of HTML. It has improved the markup available for documents and has introduced application programming interfaces (API) and Document Object Model (DOM).</li>

            <strong>CSS:</strong>What is CSS and explain it?
            CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files (. css).

            <strong>JAVASCRIPT:</strong>What language is JavaScript?
            JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods. Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages — many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes and classes.
